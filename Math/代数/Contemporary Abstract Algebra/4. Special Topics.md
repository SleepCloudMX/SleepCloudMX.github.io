# 23	Sylow Theorems

## 23.1	Conjugacy Classes

**Definition**	Conjugacy Class of $a$

> Let $a$ and $b$ be elements of a group $G$. We say that $a$ and $b$ are **conjugates** and call $b$ a **conjugate** of $a$ if $ xax\inv = b $ for some $x$ in $G$. The **conjugacy class** is the set $ \cl(a) = \Bqty{ xax\inv \mid x \in G } $.

**Theorem 23.1**	Number of Conjugates of $a$

> Let $G$ be a finite group and let $a$ be an element of $G$, then $ \vqty{\cl(a)} = \vqty{G:C(a)} $.

**Proof**	$ T: G/C(a) \to \cl(a),\, xC(a) \mapsto xax\inv $ is well-defined, one-to-one and onto.

---

- Similarly, $ \vqty{\cl(H)} = \vqty{G:N(H)} $.

**Corollary 1**	$ \vqty{\cl(a)} $ Divides $ \vqty{G} $.

> In a finite group, $ \vqty{\cl(a)} $ Divides $ \vqty{G} $.

## 23.2	The Class Equation

**Corollary 2**	Class Equation

> For any finite group $G$,
> $$
> \vqty{G} = \sum\vqty{G:C(a)},
> $$
> where the sum runs over one element $a$ from each conjugacy class of $G$.

**Theorem 23.2**	$p$-Groups Have Nontrivial Centers

> Let $G$ be a nontrivial finite group whose order is a power of a prime $p$, then $Z(G)$ has more than one element.

**Proof**	$ \cl(a) = \Bqty{a} $ if and only if $ a \in Z(G) $. By culling out these elements, $ \vqty{G} = \vqty{Z(G)} + \sum\vqty{G:C(a)} $, since $p$ divides both $\vqty{G}$ and $\vqty{G:C(a)}=p^k$, it also divides $ Z(G) $.

---

**Corollary**	Groups of Order $p^2$ Are Abelian

> If $ \vqty{G} = p^2 $, where $p$ is prime, then $G$ is Abelian.

**Proof**	$ \vqty{Z(G)} = p \text{ or } p^2 $. If $\vqty{Z(G)}=p$, then $ \vqty{G/Z(G)} = p $, so that $ G/Z(G) $ is cyclic, and hence $G$ is Abelian. (This case doesn't exist.)

---

## 23.3	The Sylow Theorems

**Theorem 23.3**	Existence of Subgroups of Prime-Power Order (Sylow First Theorem)

> Let $G$ be a ==finite group== and let $p$ be a prime. If $ p^k $ divides $ \vqty{G} $, then $G$ has at least one subgroup of order $p^k$.

- The converse of Lagrange's Theorem is true for all <u>finite Abelian groups</u> and all <u>finite groups of prime-power order</u>.

**Definition**	Sylow $p$-Subgroup

> Let $G$ be a finite group and let $p$ be a prime. If $p^k$ divides $\vqty{G}$ and $p^{k+1}$ does not divide $\vqty{G}$, then any subgroup of $G$ of order $p^k$ is called a **Sylow $p$-subgroup** of $G$.

**Corollary**	Cauchy's Theorem

> Let $G$ be a finite group and let $p$ be a prime that divides the order of $G$, then $G$ has an element of order $p$.

**Definition**	Conjugate Subgroups

> Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of a group $G$, we say that $H$ and $K$ are **conjugate** in $G$ if there is an element $g$ in $G$ such that $ H = gKg\inv $.

Recall that

- $ \orb_G(i) = \Bqty{ \phi(i) \mid \phi \in G } $, and $\vqty{\orb_G(i)}$ divides $\vqty{G}$.
- $ N(H) = \Bqty{ x \in G \mid xHx\inv = H } $.
- Conjugation is an automorphism.

**Theorem 23.4**	Sylow's Second Theorem

> If $H$ is a subgroup of a finite group $G$ and $\vqty{H}$ is a power of a prime $p$, then $H$ is contained in some Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.

**Theorem 23.5**	Sylow's Third Theorem

> Let $p$ be a prime and let $G$ be a group of order $p^km$, where $p$ does not divide $m$. Then the number $n$ of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ is ==equal to $1$== modulo $p$ and ==divides $m$==. Furthermore, any two Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are ==conjugate==.

- Let $K_1$ be any Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and let $C=\Bqty{\soneto{K}{n}}$ be the set of all conjugates of $K$ in $G$, then $ \vqty{\orb_{T(K)}(K_i)} = 1 $ if and only if $i=1$.

  $ n \equiv \vqty{C} \equiv 1 \mod{p} $, and $ \vqty{C} = \vqty{G:N(K)} $.
  
- Note that if a Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal, then $ n_p = \vqty{G:N(K)} = \vqty{G:G} = 1 $, it's also unique.

**Corollary**	A Unique Sylow $p$-Subgroup Is Normal

> A Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite group $G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ is and only if it is the only Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.

## 23.4	Applications of Sylow Theorems

**Theorem 23.6**	Cyclic Groups of Order $pq$

> If $G$ is a group of order $pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes, $p<q$, and $ p \nmid q-1 $, then $G$ is isomorphic to $\Z_{pq}$.

**Proof**	The number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ is of the form $1+kp$ and divides $q$, so $ 1+kp = 1 \text{ or } q $, so $k=0$, Simiarly, there is only one Sylow $p$-subgroup $H$ of $G$, and only one Sylow $q$-subgroup $K$ of $G$, all of which are normal, so $ G = HK $ and $ H \cap K = \Bqty{e} $, thus $ G = H \times K \approx \Z_p \oplus \Z_q \approx \Z_{pq} $.

The number of groups of any order less than 2048 is given at http://oeis.org/A000001/b000001.txt

# 24	Finite Simple Groups

## 24.1	Historical Background

**Definition**	Simple Group

> A group is **simple** if its only normal subgroups are the identity subgroup and the group itself.

- The series of simple groups $ G_0/G_1, G_1/G_2, \cdots, G_{n-1}/G_n $ are called the **composition factors** of $G=G_0$.

Simple groups families examples

- The Abelian simple groups is $\Z_p$.
- $A_n$ is simple for all $n\ge5$.
- $ \mathrm{PSL}(n, \Z_p) \equiv \SL(n, \Z_p) / Z(\SL(n, \Z_p)) $ except when $n=2$ and $p=2\text{ or }3$.
- **Feit-Thompson Theorem**: A non-Abelian simple group has even order.
- The largest sporadic simple group: Monster. $%of order 808, 017, 424, 794, 512, 875, 886, 459, 904, 961, 710, 757, 005, 754, 368, 000, 000, 000$

## 24.2	Nonsimplicity Tests

**Theorem 24.1**	Sylow Test for Nonsimplicity

> Let $n$ be a positive integer that is not prime, and let $p$ be a prime divisor of $n$. If $1$ is the only divisor of $n$ that is equal to $1$ modulo $p$, then there does not exist a simple group of order $n$.

**Proof**

If $n$ is a prime-power, then a group of order $n$ has a nontrivial center and therefore is not simple.

Else, the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of a group of order $n$ is equal to $1$ modulo $p$ and divides $n$. Therefore the number is $1$ and hence the Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal.

---

**Theorem 24.2**	$2\cdot\text{Odd}$ Test

> An integer of the form $2\cdot n$, where $n$ is an odd number greater than $1$, is not the order of a simple group.

**Proof**

$ \phi: G \to S,\, g \mapsto T_g $, where $ T_g(x) = gx $ is an isomorphism from $G$ to its permutation group. Since $\vqty{G}=2n$, there is an element $g$ in $G$ of order $2$. Then, when $T_g$ is written in disjoint cycle form, each cycle must have length $1$ or $2$. But $1$-cycle (x) would mean $x=T_g(x)=gx$ and $g=e$. Thus $T_g$ consists of exactly $n$ transpositions. Therefore $T_g$ is an odd permutation. This means that the set of even permutation has index $2$ and hence normal.

---

**Theorem 24.3**	Generalized Cayley Theorem

> Let $G$ be a group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Let $S$ be the group of all permutations of <u>the left cosets</u> of $H$ in $G$. Then there is a homomorphism from $G$ into $S$ whose kernel lies in $H$ and contains every normal subgroup of $G$ that is contained in $H$.

**Proof**

Define $ T_g(xH) = gxH $, then $ \alpha: g \mapsto T_g $ is a homomorphism from $G$ into $S$.

If $ g \in \Ker\alpha $, then $H=T_g(X)=gH$, thus $g\subseteq H$.

If $K$ is normal and $K\subseteq H$, then $kx=xk',\,T_k(xH)=kxH=xk'H=xH$ is a identity permutation, thus $k\in\Ker\alpha$.

---

- The kernel itself is a normal subgroup.
- If $ \vqty{G:H} = p $, where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $G$, then $H$ is normal.

**Corollary 1**	Index Theorem

> If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ such that $\vqty{G}$ does not divide $\vqty{G:H}!$, then $H$ contains a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$. In particular, $G$ is not simple.

**Proof**

$\Ker\alpha$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ contained in $H$ and $G/\Ker\alpha$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S$. Thus, $ \vqty{G/\Ker\alpha} = \vqty{G} / \vqty{\Ker\alpha} $ divides $ \vqty{S} = \vqty{G:H}! $, and the order of $\Ker\alpha$ must be greater than $1$.

---

**Corollary 2**	Embedding Theorem

> If a ==finite non-Abelian simple== group $G$ has a subgroup of index $n$, then $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $A_n$.

Non-Abelian simple groups of order less than $200$:

- Icosahedral (Or dodecahedron) group: $A_5$.
- $ \mathrm{PSL}(2, \Z_7) = \SL(2, \Z_7) / Z(\SL(2, \Z_7)) $.

---

- Every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$ for some $n$ (Cayley's Theorem), and $S_n$ is a subgroup of $A_{n+2}$, so every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a finite simple group.

# 25	Generators and Relations

## 25.1	Motivation

## 25.2	Definitions and Notation

- For any set $ S = \Bqty{a, b, c, \cdots} $, define $ S\inv = \Bqty{a\inv, b\inv, c\inv, \cdots} $, $ W(S) = \Bqty{ x_1 x_2 \cdots x_k \mid x_i \in S \cup S\inv, k \in \N } $.

- The elements in $W(S)$ is called **words** from $S$, and the word is called the **empty word** $e$ when $k=0$.
- Define a binary operation such that $ \forall x, y \in W(S), xy \in W(S) $.
- Notice that $aa\inv$ is not $e$, $(ab)\inv$ is not $b\inv a\inv$.

**Definition**	Equivalence Classes of Words

> For any pair of elements $u$ and $v$ of $W(S)$, we say that $u$ is **related** to $v$ if $v$ can be obtained from $u$ by a finite sequence of insertions or deletions of words of the form $xx\inv$ of $x\inv x$, where $ x\in S $.

## 25.3	Free Group

**Theorem 25.1**	Equivalence Classes Form a Group

> Let $S$ be a set of distinct symbols. For any word $u$ in $W(S)$, let $\bar{u}$ denote the set of all words in $W(S)$ equivalent to $u$. Then the set of all equivalence classes of elements of $W(S)$ is a group under the operation $ \overline{u} \cdot \overline{v} = \overline{uv} $.

## 25.4	Generators and Relations

**Definition**	Generators and Relations

> Let $G$ be a group generated by some subset $ A = \Bqty{\soneto{a}{n}} $ and let $F$ be the free group on $A$. Let $ W = \Bqty{\soneto{w}{t}} $ be a subset of $F$ and let $N$ be the smallest normal subgroup of $F$ containing $W$. We say that $G$ is given by the generators $ \soneto{a}{n} $ and the relations $ w_1 = w_2 = \cdots = w_t = e $ if there is an isomorphism from $F/N$ onto $G$ that carries $a_iN$ to $a_i$.

- $ G = \aqty{ \soneto{a}{n} \mid w_1 = w_2 = \cdots = w_t = e } $, and the RHS is called the **presentation**.
- The only nontrivial Abelian group that is free: $ \Z \approx \aqty{a} $.

**Theorem 25.3**	Dyck's Theorem (1882)

> Let $ G_1 = \aqty{ \soneto{a}{n} \mid w_1 = w_2 = \cdots = w_t = e } $, and $ G_2 = \aqty{ \soneto{a}{n} \mid w_1 = w_2 = \cdots = w_t = w_{t+1} = \cdots = w_{t+k} = e } $, then $G_2$ is a homomorphic image of $G_1$.

**Corollary**	Largest Group Satisfying Defining Relations

> If $K$ is a group satisfying the defining relations of a finite group $G$ and $ \vqty{K} \ge \vqty{G} $, then $ K \approx G $.

> Up to isomorphism, there are only five groups of order 8: $ \Z_8, \Z_4 \oplus \Z_2, \Z_2 \oplus \Z_2 \oplus \Z_2, D_4, Q_4 $ (quaternions).

- Quaternions: $ Q_4 = \aqty{ a, b \mid a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 } $.
- **Dicyclic group** of order $4n$: $ Q_{2n} = \aqty{ a, b \mid a^{2n} = e, a^n = b^2, b\inv ab = a\inv }$, $ Z(Q_{2n}) = \Bqty{e, x^n}$, $ Q_{2n} / Z(Q_{2n}) \approx D_n $.

**Definition**	Elements Fixed by $\phi$

**Proof**	Let $N$ denote the number of pairs $ (\phi, i),\, \phi \in G, u \in S,\, \phi(i) = i $, and count these pairs in two ways:
$$

N &= \sum_{\phi \in G} \vqty{\fix(\phi)} %\quad\text{(For each $\phi$ in $G$)} \\ &
= \sum_{i \in S} \vqty{\stab_G(i)}

**Definition**	Cayley Digraph of a Group

> Let $G$ be a finite group and let $S$ be a set of generators for $G$. We define a digraph (directed graph) $ \mathrm{Cay}(S:G) $, called the **Cayley digraph** of $G$ with generating set $S$, as follows:
>
> 1. Each element of $G$ is a **vertex** of $ \mathrm{Cay}(S:G) $.

**Theorem 28.2**	A Sufficient Condition

> $ \mathrm{Cay}(\Bqty{(1,0), (0,1)} : \Z_m \oplus \Z_n) $ has a ==Hamiltonian circuit== when $ n \mid m $.

- This Hamiltonian circuit can be denoted by $ m * [(n-1) * (0,1), (0,1)] $.

**Theorem 28.3**	Abelian Groups Have Hamiltonian Paths

> Let $G$ be a finite Abelian group, and let $S$ be any generating set for $G$, then $ \mathrm{Cay} (S:G) $ has a ==Hamiltonian path==.

- $ (\soneto{a}{k}, s, \soneto{a}{k}, s, \cdots, \soneto{a}{k}, s, \soneto{a}{k}) $.
- It can be generalized to include all **Hamiltonian groups**, all of whose subgroups are normal. (One non-Abelian example is $Q_4$.)

## 29.2	Linear Codes

**Definition**	Linear Code

> An $ (n, k) $ **linear code** over a finite field $\F$ is a $k$-dimensional subspace $V$ of the vector space $ \F^n = \underbrace{ \F \oplus \F \oplus \cdots \oplus \F }_{n\text{ copies}} $ over $\F$. The members of $V$ are called the **code words**. When $ \F = \Z_2 $, the code is called **binary**. When $ \F = \Z_3 $, the code is called **ternary**.

- In a binary linear code
  - For all digits, either all the code words are 0, or exactly half of them are 0.
  - Either every member has even weight, or exactly half of them has even weight.

**Definition**	Hamming Distance, Hamming Weight

> The **Hamming distance** between two vectors in $\F^n$ is the number of components in which they differ. The **Hamming weight** of a ==vector== is the number of nonzero components of the vector. The **Hamming weight** of a ==linear code== is the minimum weight of any nonzero vector in the code.

- Hamming distance: $ d(u, v) $.
- Hamming weight: $ \wt(u) $.

**Theorem 29.1**	Properties of Hamming Distance and Hamming Weight

> 1. $ d(u, v) \le d(u, w) + d(w, v) $.
> 2. $ d(u, v) = \wt(u-v) $.

- $ d(u, v) = d(v, u) $.
- $ d(u, v) = 0 \QRLA u=v $.
- $ d(u, v) = d(u+w, v+w) $.

**Theorem 29.2**	Correcting Capability of a Linear Code

> If the Hamming weight of a linear code is at least $ 2t+1\; (t \in \Q^+) $, then the code can ==correct== any $t$ or fewer errors. Alternatively, the same code can ==detect== any $2t$ or fewer errors.

**Proof**	1. For a transmitted code word $u$ and a received code word $v$, consider a code word other than $u$, then
$$
2t+1 \le \wt(w-u) = d(w, u) \le d(w, v) + d(v, u) \le d(w, v) + t,
$$
so the code word closest to $v$ is $u$.

2. $ d(u, v) \le 2t $, but the minimum distance between distinct code words is at least $2t+1$.

---

- The converse of Theorem 29.2 is also true.

- We can't do both simultaneously.

- If we write the Hamming weight of a linear code in the form $ 2t+s+1 $, we can correct any $t$ or fewer errors and detect any $t+s$ or fewer erros. :star:

- For example, for a code with Hamming weight 5, we have options as follows

  1. Detect any four errors ($ t=0, s=4 $).
  2. Correct any one error and detect any two or three errors ($ t=1, s=2 $).
  3. Correct any two errors ($ t=2, s=0 $).

- A matrix of the following form is called the **standard generator matrix** (or **standard encoding matrix**), which produces a **systematic code**.
  $$
  G = \begin{pmatrix}
  	\begin{array}{cccc|ccc}
  		1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1, n-k} \\
  		0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 & a_{21} & \cdots & a_{2, n-k} \\
  		\vdots & \vdots && \vdots & \vdots && \vdots \\
  		0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & a_{k1} & \cdots & a_{k, n-k} \\
  	\end{array}
  \end{pmatrix}.
  $$

## 29.3	Parity-Check Matrix Decoding

If there is only one error:

Suppose that $V$ is a systematic linear code over the field $\F$ given by the standard generator matrix $ G = [I_k|A] $, then $ H = \begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{c} -A\\ \hline I_{n-k} \end{array}\end{bmatrix} $ is the **parity-check matrix** for $V$.

1. For any received word $w$, compute $ wH $.

2. If $wH$ is the zero vector, assume that no error was made.

3. If there is exactly one instance of a nonzero element $ s \in \F $ and a row $i$ of $H$ such that $ wH = sH_i $, assume that the sent word was $ w - (0\cdots s \cdots 0) $, where $s$ occurs in the $i$^th^ component.

   (When the code is binary, if $wH$ is the $i$^th^ row of $H$ for exactly one $i$...)

- It cannot detect any multiple errors, and we have restrictions on the parity-check matrix.

**Lemma 29.1**	Orthogonality Relation

> Let $C$ be a systematic $ (n, k) $ linear code over $\F$ with a standard generator matrix $G$ and parity-check matrix $H$. Then, for any vector $v$ in $ \F^n $, we have $ vH = \vb*{0} \RLA v \in C $.

**Proof**	$ \dim(\Ker{H}) = k $,
$$
\begin{align}
	GH &= [I_k | A] \begin{bmatrix}
		\begin{array}{c}
			-A \\ \hline I_{n-k}
		\end{array}
	\end{bmatrix}
	= -A + A = [0] \text{\quad(the zero matrix)}
	\\
	vH &= (mG)H = m[0] = 0 \text{\quad(the zero vector)}
\end{align}
$$

---

**Theorem 29.3**	Parity-Check Matrix

> Parity-check matrix decoding will correct any single error if and only if the rows of the parity-check matrix are <u>nonzero</u> and <u>no one row is a scalar multiple of any other row</u>.

**Proof**	$ (w+e_i)H = wH + e_iH = e_iH $.

## 29.4	Coset Decoding

- Construct a table called a **standard array** whose words in the first column are called the **coset leaders**.
- A table of an $ (n, k) $ linear code over a field with $q$ elemnts will have $ \vqty{C} = q^k $ columns and $ \vqty{V:C} = q^{n-k} $ rows.

**Theorem 29.4**	Coset Decoding Is Nearest-Neighbor Decoding

> In coset decoding, a received word $w$ is decoded as a code word $c$ such that $ d(w, c) $ is a minimum.

**Proof**	Suppose that $v$ is the coset leader for the coset $ w + C $, then $ w+C = v+C,\, w = v + c $ for some $ c \in C $. Now, if $c'$ is any code word, then $ w-c' \in w + C = v + C,\, \wt(w-c') \ge \wt(v+C) = \wt(v) $, therefore
$$
d(w, c') = \wt(w-c') \ge \wt(v) = \wt(w-c) = d(w, c).
$$

**Definition**	Syndrome

> If an $ (n, k) $ linear code over $\F$ has parity-check matrix $H$, then, for any vector $u$ in $\F^n$, the vector $uH$ is called the **syndrome** of $u$.

**Theorem 29.5**	Same Coset$-$Same Syndrome

> Let $C$ be an $ (n, k) $ linear code over $\F$ with a parity-check matrix $H$. Then, two vectors of $\F^n$ are in the same coset of $C$ if and only if they have the same syndrome.

**Proof**	$ u, v \in w + C \QRLA u-v \in C \QRLA 0 = (u-v)H = uH - vH $.

---

Steps

1. Calculate the syndrome $wH$.
2. Find the coset leader $v$ such that $ wH = vH $.
3. Assume that the vector sent was $ w-v $.

**Definitions**	Automorphism, Galois Group, Fixed Field of $H$

> Let $\E$ be an extension field of the field $\F$. An **automorphism** of $\E$ is a ring isomorphism from $\E$ onto $\E$. The **Galois group** of $\E$ over $\F$, $ \Gal(\E/\F) $, is the set of all <u>automorphisms</u> of $\E$ that <u>take every element of $\F$ to itself</u>. If $H$ is a subgroup of $ \Gal(\E/\F) $, then the set
> $$
> \E_H = \Bqty{ x \in \E \mid \phi(x) = x \text{ for all } \phi \in H }
> $$
> is called the **fixed field** of $H$.

- Let $\mathscr{F}$ be the lattice of subfields of $\E$ containing $\F$, and let $\mathscr{G}$ be the lattice of subgroups of $\Gal(\E/\F)$, then

$$
\begin{array}{|ccc|cc}
	g: & \mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{G} & \quad\quad\quad &
	f: & \mathscr{G} \to \mathscr{F} \\
	& \K \mapsto \Gal(\E/\K) &&
	& H \mapsto \E_H
\end{array}
$$

- $ \K \subseteq \L \QRA g(\K) \supseteq g(\L) $.
- $ G \subseteq H \QRA f(G) \supseteq f(H) $.

- $ \forall\, \K \in \mathscr{F},\, (fg)\K \supseteq \K $.
- $ \forall G \in \mathscr{G},\, (fg)G \supseteq G $.

**Theorem 30.1**	Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory

> Let $\F$ be a field of characteristic 0 or a finite field. If $\E$ is the splitting field over $\F$ for some polynomial in $\F[x]$, then $ g: \mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{G},\, \K \mapsto \Gal(\E/\K) $ is a one-to-one correspondence. Furthermore, for any subfield $\K$ of $\E$ containing $\F$,
>
> 1. $ [\E:\K] = \vqty{\Gal(\E/\K)},\, [\K:\F] = \vqty{\Gal(\E/\F)} / \vqty{\Gal((\E/\K))} $.
>
>    (The index of $ \Gal(\E/\K) $ in $ \Gal(\E/\F) $ equals the degree of $\K$ over $\F$.)
>
> 2. If $\K$ is the splitting field of some polynomimal in $\F[x]$, then $ \Gal(\E/\K) $ is a normal subgroup of $ \Gal(\E/\F) $, and $ \Gal(\K/\F) \approx \Gal(\E/\F) / \Gal(\E/\K) $.
>
> 3. $ \K = \E_{\Gal(\E/\K)} $. (The fixed field of $\Gal(\E/\K)$ is $\K$.)
>
> 4. If $H$ is a subgroup of $\Gal(\E/\F)$, then $ H = \Gal(\E/\E_H) $.
>
>    (The automorphism group of $\E$ fixing $\E_H$ is $H$.)

- $ \Gal(\GF(p^n)/\GF(p)) \approx \Z_n $.

  **Proof**	Say $ \F = \GF(p)$, $ \GF(p^n) = \F(b) $, where $b$ is the zero of an irreducible polynomial $ p(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0,\, a_i \in \F $.

  $ p(b) = 0 = \phi(p(b)) = p(\phi(b)) $, so there are at most $n$ possibilities for $\phi(b)$.

  $ \sigma: \E \to \E,\, a \mapsto a^p $ is an automorphism, and $\E^*$ is cyclic, so $\vqty{\sigma}$ has order $n$.

  Thus, $ \Gal(\GF(p^n)/\GF(p)) \approx \Z_n $.

## 30.2	Solvability of Polynomials by Radicals

**Definition**	Solvable by Radicals

> Let $\F$ be a field, and let $ f(x) \in \F[x] $. We say that $f(x)$ is **solvable by radicals** over $\F$ if $f(x)$ splits in some extension $ \F(\soneto{a}{n}) $ of $\F$ and there exist positive integers $ \soneto{k}{n} $ such that $ a_1^{k_1} \in \F $ and $ a_i^{k_i} \in \F(\soneto{a}{n-1}) $ for $ i = 2, 3, \cdots, n $.

**Definition**	Solvable Group

> We say that a group $G$ is solvable if $G$ has a series subgroups
> $$
> \Bqty{e} = H_0 \subset H_1 \subset H_2 \subset \cdots \subset H_k = G,
> $$
> where for each $ 0 \le i \lt k $, $H_i$ is normal in $H_{i+1}$ and $ H_{i+1}/H_i $ is Abelian.

- If $G$ is a finite solvable group, then there exist subgroups of $G$
  $$
  \Bqty{e} = H_0 \subset H_1 \subset H_2 \subset \cdots \subset H_n = G
  $$
  such that $ H_{i+1}/H_i $ has prime order.

- A subgroup of a solvable group is solvable.

**Examples**

- Solvable groups: <u>Abelian groups</u>, <u>dihedral groups</u>, groups of orde $p^n$.
- Every group <u>of odd order</u> is solvable. (Feit-Thompson Theorem)
- Any non-Abelian simple group is not solvable.
- $S_n$ is solvable if and only if $ n \le 4 $.

**Theorem 30.2**	Condition for $\Gal(\E/\F)$ to be Solvable

> Let $\F$ be a field of characteristic 0 and let $ a \in \F $. If $\E$ is the splitting field of $ x^n - a $ over $\F$, then the Galois group $ \Gal(\E/\F) $ is solvable.

**Theorem 30.3**	Factor Group of a Solvable Group Is Solvable

> A factor group of a solvable group is solvable.

**Theorem 30.4**	$N$ and $G/N$ Solvable Implies $G$ is Solvable

> Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$. If both $N$ and $G/N$ are solvable, then $G$ is solvable.

**Theorem 30.5**	Solvable by Radicals Implies Solvable Group (Galois)

> Let $\F$ be a field of characteristic 0 and let $ f(x) \in \F[x] $. Suppose that $f(x)$ splits in $ \F(\soneto{a}{t}) $, where $ a_1^{n_1} \in \F $ and $ a_i^{n_i} \in \F(\soneto{a}{i-1}) $ for $ i = 2, 3, \cdots, t $. Let $\E$ be the splitting field for $f(x)$ over $\F$ in $ \F(\soneto{a}{t}) $, then the Galois group $ \Gal(\E/\F) $ is solvable.

- The converse is true also: if $\E$ is the splitting field of a polynomial $f(x)$ over a field $\F$ of characteristic 0 and $\Gal(\E/\F)$ is solvable, then $f(x)$ is solvable by radicals over $\F$.
- Every finite group is a Galois group over some field.
- Every solvable group is a Galois group over $\Q$.
